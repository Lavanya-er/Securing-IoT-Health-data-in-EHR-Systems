# Securing-IoT-Health-data-in-EHR-Systems
The project "Securing IoT Health Data in EHR System" ensures the protection of patient data by simulating secure handling using an ATMEGA328 microcontroller. An RFID module restricts access to authorized users. Encryption and decryption are handled using MATLAB and the encrypted data is stored in MongoDB on the AWS cloud. This provides security.
